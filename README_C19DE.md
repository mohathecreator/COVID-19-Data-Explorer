# COVID-19 Data Explorer
(for German Version scroll down)
## Description
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Explorer!
This project is one of my first projects and should showcase my ability in programming and data manipulation and visualization. 

With the COVID-19 Data Explorer you can visualize different COVID-19 cases (e.g.: confirmed, death or recovered cases) for different countries in different time periods.

Thank you for using it and have fun exploring!
